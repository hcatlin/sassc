About SassC
-----------

SassC is a wrapper around libsass (http://github.com/sass/libsass)
used to generate a useful command-line application that can be installed
and packaged for several operating systems.

SassC currently statically links the libsass library, but might one
day using dynamic linking if libsass supports that in the future.

About Sass
----------

Sass is a CSS pre-processor language to add on exciting, new,
awesome features to CSS. Sass was the first language of its kind
and by far the most mature and up to date codebase.

Sass was originally created by the co-creator of this library,
Hampton Catlin ([@hcatlin]). The extension and continuing evolution
of the language has all been the result of years of work by Natalie
Weizenbaum ([@nex3]) and Chris Eppstein ([@chriseppstein]).
